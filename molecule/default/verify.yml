- name: Verify
  hosts: all
  tasks:

    # NOTE that verify.yml does not inherit values from your playbook in anyway, they are seperate playbooks and run seperately.

    - name: define packages, files, directories and other stuff you want to check lots of
      set_fact:
        required_certs:
          - blog.positivessl.com
          - comodoca.com

          - {scheme: 'http', domain: 'avs.sectigo.com', status: 301, location: 'https://avs.sectigo.com'}

    - name: include the standard verifier. This is arguably somewhat redundant now that all verification tasks are in one file
      include_tasks: ../default/tasks/verify_root.yml

  # NOTE: if you have a task you wish to exclude from the molecule idempotence check, you can either remove the idempotence phase entirely in molecule.yml
  # or you can exclude a specific task by adding the tag ```molecule-idempotence-notest``` to the task

  # Add role specific tests here
